# Ionic Gizmos
Few Ionic directives I want to share.

## Content
 - [item-swipe-pane](https://github.com/MichalFoksa/ionic-gizmos/tree/master/item-swipe-pane) - element directive which creates a container inside a `ion-item`, which is visible when the item is swiped to the left or to the right.

 - [can-swipe](https://github.com/MichalFoksa/ionic-gizmos/tree/master/can-swipe) - attribute directive which can enable/disable swipe functionality of an individual `ion-item` element.
